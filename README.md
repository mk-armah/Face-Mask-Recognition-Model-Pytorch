An image classification model to detect Faces with Properly worn Nose Mask, Faces with Improperly worn Face Masks and Faces without Face Mask.
The Dataset were collected from **************************************

The Dataset can be accessed in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IvMClQZ7U4zjN89w-XYSWa7AXZGIE_4g?usp=sharing


# Usage
Each folder contains images named as with the following preceding names:

### masked: 
images containing face wearing mask

### incorrectly_masked:
Images containing faces with incorrectly worn face mask


### no_mask : 
images containing face without wearing mask

Depending on your purpose, you can split the data into non-masked vs masked images by checking for the term "no_mask" on the name of the file. All the files contains this term will be non-masked images and the rest should be masked ones.
